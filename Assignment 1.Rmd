## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Read CSV
```{r}
url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivethirtyeight/guns-data/master/full_data.csv"
gun_deaths <- read_csv(url)
glimpse(gun_deaths)

```
##Filter dataset by age

```{r}
youth <- filter(gun_deaths, age<=65)

```

We have data about 100798 individuals killed by guns. Only 15687 are older than 65. The distribution of the remainder is shown below

```{r youth-dist, echo=FALSE}

youth %>% 
  ggplot(aes(age))+
  geom_freqpoly(binwidth=1)

```
## Gun deaths by race

```{r race-dist, echo=FALSE}
youth %>% 
  ggplot(aes(fct_infreq(race) %>% fct_rev()))+
  geom_bar()+coord_flip()+
  labs(x = "Victim race")

```
